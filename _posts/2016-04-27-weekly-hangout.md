title: "weekly hangout: C++ prorgess, Maven Central, go-kit"
---

Rough notes:

- @lookfwd has been looking at automake and autoconf
  - actual OT library was fine, but would be hard to use the lib without the above tools
- @jmacd has been working on a C++ lib with a customer; they understand that a syntactic migration is likely down the line and are ok with that. As such, proceeding with an "OT in spirit" implementation and will merge with OT C++ proper in a few weeks.
- we talked about custom allocators
- @lookfwd will clean things up this weekend
- @jmacd to coordinate with @lookfwd
- @yurishkuro is continuing work on Java
- @bensigelman reports that @bcronin is learning about Maven Central Repo madness which will hopefully help with the OT-Java artifact as well
- @bensigelman to send something to the go-kit folks in the next week per https://github.com/go-kit/kit/issues/237
