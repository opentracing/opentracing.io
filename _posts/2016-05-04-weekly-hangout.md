meeting notes

- Java-wise, Kike finally got the Java version working with their services
  - Thread-locals kind of nasty
  - No problems with the OpenTracing
- @bensigelman to talk with colleagues releasing an OpenTracing .jar
- @bg451 was talking with the CTO of CoreOS; he was saying that a simple example app showing the benefits of tracing would make sense
  - The example app thing is roughly done and easily switch between tracers
  - Should look for single-VM zipkin-docker container
  - Good to get Appdash-python set up
- @pritianka talked about OpenTracing blog and marketing materials
  - @yurishkuro was going to do some content marketing for Uber that would be good to cross-post
  - @bg451 was talking about Jonathan Mace's work adding PivotTracing to HDFS; something similar would be nice
