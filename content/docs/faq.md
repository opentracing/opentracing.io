## Why do I need OpenTracing?

IT and DevOps teams can use distributed tracing to monitor applications.  Distributed tracing is particularly well-suited to debugging and monitoring modern distributed software architectures, such as microservices. Developers can use distributed tracing to help debug and optimize their code.

## How do I download OpenTracing?

OpenTracing is not a download or a program.  Distributed tracing requires that software developers add instrumentation to the code of an application, or to the frameworks used in the application.

## Is there an official Tracer for OpenTracing? Which tracers are supported?

OpenTracing is vendor neutral, so there is not an official tracer.

Here is the [list of tracers ](/docs/supported-tracers) that support the OpenTracing specification.

## Which languages are supported?

* Go
* C++
* C#
* Java
* Javascript
* Objective-C
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
